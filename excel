ðŸ“Š Loan Approval Dashboard | Advanced Excel Project
Proud to share my latest projectâ€”a dynamic and interactive Loan Approval Analysis Dashboard built using Advanced Excel. This project allowed me to explore how demographic factors influence loan approvals using powerful Excel tools like:

ðŸ”¹ Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts
ðŸ”¹ Slicers for filtering (Gender, Education, Property Area, etc.)
ðŸ”¹ Conditional Formatting for clear visuals
ðŸ”¹ Chart types: Donut, Bar, and Column for comparative analysis

ðŸ’¡ Key Highlights:
Visual insights on how self-employment, dependents, and marital status affect loan status.

Drill-down on income and loan amount comparisons.

Real-time filtering and interaction through slicers.
